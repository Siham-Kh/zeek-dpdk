Zeek::Dpdk
=================================

This plugin provides native DPDK support for Zeek as a packet source.



Installation
------------

Follow DPDK (20.11)'s instructions to configure, build and install DPDK:
    https://doc.dpdk.org/guides/linux_gsg/build_dpdk.html


Install zeek by following the instructions on this link:
    https://docs.zeek.org/en/current/install/install.html


Build the plugin:
    ./configure --zeek-dist=/path/to/zeek/director
    make
    sudo make install
    Export the ZEEK_PLUGIN_PATH to take in consideration the plugin location: export ZEEK_PLUGIN_PATH=/home/snk14/zeek-3.2.3/auxil/zeek-aux/plugin-support/zeek-dpdk/build


Usage
------------

For pysical devices: 
    - Unbind the device to be by DPDK from the kernel

For Virtual devices:
    - No need, via --vdev in the configure file or by hardcoding it in the plugin

    
Assign some huge pages
    - e.g echo 1024 > /sys/kernel/mm/hugepages/hugepages-2048kB/nr_hugepages


The zeek-dpdk plugin can be used to monitor the device by using the following cmmand:
    - zeek -i dpdk::0000.19.00.0



Limitations:
------------

- So far all dpdk options are hardcoded --> either read from a file or something else
- Consider optimization later on (concurrent cores, ...)
